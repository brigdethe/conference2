# Frontend-only edits

- **Edit only:** Express app frontend (routes that serve pages, `views/`, `app.js` page/API wiring used by the frontend), `frontend-final/` (React onboarding), `quantro-main/` (React admin UI), and frontend assets (CSS, JS, static files).
- **Do not edit:** `backend/` (Python FastAPI, routers, models, DB), database files, deployment/config that changes backend behavior.
- **APIs:** You may call existing backend APIs from the frontend; do not add or change backend endpoints or logic. If a feature needs a new API, note that backend changes are out of scope.
